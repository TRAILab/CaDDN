## Changelog
[2021-03-16] `CaDDN` v0.3.0 is released.

## Introduction


### What does `CaDDN` do?

`CaDDN` is a general PyTorch-based method for 3D object detection from monocular images.
At the time of submission, `CaDDN` achieved first 1st place among published monocular methods on the [Kitti 3D object detection benchmark](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_object.php?obj_benchmark=3d). We welcome contributions to this project.

### `CaDDN` design pattern
We inherit the design pattern from [`[OpenPCDet]`](https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet).

* Data-Model separation with unified point cloud coordinate for easily extending to custom datasets:

* Unified 3D box definition: (x, y, z, dx, dy, dz, heading).

## Model Zoo

### KITTI 3D Object Detection Baselines
Selected supported methods are shown in the below table. The results are the 3D detection performance of Car class on the *val* set of KITTI dataset.
* All models are trained with 2 Tesla T4 GPUs and are available for download.
* The training time is measured with 2 Tesla T4 GPUs and PyTorch 1.4.
